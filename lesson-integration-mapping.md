# Test Question Integration into Lesson Plans

## Mapping Strategy

Based on the Grade 4 English PAL-Integrated Lesson Plans PDF and the existing test questions, here's how we'll integrate them:

---

## Lesson 1: Decoding Multi-Syllable Words
**Focus:** Syllable breaking, pronunciation, reading confidence
**PAL Practice:** Syllable-based word reading, Tap + listen + read

### Test Questions to Integrate: NONE
**Reason:** Lesson 1 focuses on syllable decoding, not sentence construction. No test questions match this focus.

## Lesson 2: Vocabulary in Context (Meaning Matters)
**Focus:** Word meaning, oral sentence formation, written usage
**PAL Practice:** Picture-word matching, Choose correct word for sentence

### Test Questions to Integrate:
