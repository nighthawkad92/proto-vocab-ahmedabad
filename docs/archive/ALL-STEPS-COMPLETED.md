## 🎯 What's Next? (Your Choice)

### The Ball Is In Your Court

I've completed ALL the automated steps. What remains requires your manual interaction:

**Manual Testing (You need to do this):**
- Open the browser
- Log in
- Click through the interface
- Test the 20 questions
- Verify everything works

**Why you need to do this:**
- I can't interact with the browser UI
- I can't click buttons or drag elements
- I can't verify the visual experience
- This is the ONE thing that requires human testing

**How long it takes:** 30-60 minutes

**What to do:** Follow [TESTING-STATUS.md](TESTING-STATUS.md) or [QUICK-START-TESTING.md](QUICK-START-TESTING.md)
